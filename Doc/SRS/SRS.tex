\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of Pong Invaders is, at its core, to help cure the boredom of its
users. Pong Invaders looks to bring back the best of the pioneer gaming
generation with a new twist to bring these classical favourites back up to
speedwith today’s games. This game will allow anyone with a computer to either
relivetwo of their favourite games or for a new generation to be exposed to the
origins of gaming. With the completion of Pong Invaders anyone with a computer
will be able to get their hands on the remodelled duo of Space Invaders and
Pong.
\subsection{The Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{The Client}
The client for our project is Professor Spencer Smith, 3XA3 Instructor of
McMaster University.
\subsubsection{The Customers}
The primary customer will be the general public interested in playing Pong
Invaders. Any individual with internet access able to download the game would
constitute as a viable customer for Pong Invaders.
\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
General Public
The general public will constitute our consumer base as a whole will makeup the
remaining stakeholders. These stakeholders need not be involved in the
re-development process since it is a remodelling of two previously made games
with already given specifications and requirements. This allows for the general
public to be focussed towards creating a player base for Pong Invaders.
\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
Description: Pong Invaders will be available for anyone able to download the
jarfile and a computer to run it on.
 
Rationale: The jar file download will allow users to run the game on any
computer platform with internet access.
 
Fit Criterion: Pong Invaders will be available to users that can run and
download the jar file.
 

Description: The Game window will be set to a static 640x480.
 
Rationale: keeping the game on static window dimensions will allow for less
problems when adding the pong overlay.
 
Fit Criterion: The window size will be kept static to ensure game
functionality.\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

resolution of 640x480.


Style Requirements

The style Pong Invaders is trying to illustrate to the user is the retro-arcade
style of the games from the 90’s. Also, when an invader is destroyed by the
space ship or the pong ball, the explosion of the invader must be satisfying
forthe user.

None.


\subsection{Maintainability and Support Requirements}
How easy is it to maintain
Pong Invaders is relatively easy to maintain as it requires little updates
afterit is initially launched and might require some accessory downloads if
there is
more content added. The application will be patched based on user feedback for
the game after release.
 
Special maintenance conditions
In a special case where there is a critical error found in the code the current
jar may need to be deleted and completely re-downloaded to ensure proper
execution of the game.
 
Portability
The jar file will be available anywhere a user can access the internet and the
game can be taken anywhere the user is willing to take their computer.

required:-Java Development kit 1.8 or higher

All software can be received for free off the Internet as it is opensource.

Effects on the Current Environment 
None.

Potential User Problems:

Some user problems that can occur from the product is eye soreness/eye strain
from extended playing. Users may not be able to correctly follow installation
instructions due to inexperience with Java.

Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the
New Product:

Computers that are old may not be able to run the product at optimal quality.
Meaning sluggish performance and drop in frames per second.

Follow-Up Problems 

If one of the developers are not able to hand in major deliverables on time,
this can delay the release of the product for an indefinite time. If Java
Development Kit 1.8 is not supported in the near future by Oracle.

Planning of the Development 

Phases Phase 1 Model Implementation and Revision: This phase is important as
this will be the structure and backbone of the project. This is when the game
will be set up and how each module interacts with each other. This is crucial
tocomplete before any coding is started. The product shall be based on this
model.Phase 2 Programming Implementation: This phase is where construction of
the
product begins. Here the game will be created and tested. The program shall run
on desktop. The client will check if all requirements are met for the game and
decide if game will be released. Phase 3 Maintenance: At this point for optimal
game experience the game shall be maintained at a high standard. This shall be
completed and reviewed regularly or upon notice. The program will be
continuallyplayable throughout years to come. The program will remain functional
as long asthe client deems fit.


\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
Not applicable to this project.

\subsection{Risks}
Risks for this project center mainly around productivity and time constraints.
Since Pong Invaders will consist of a meshing of two games it requires strong
time commitment and high productivity. Failure to do so may result in forced
downscaling or extension of the project.

\subsection{Costs}
Costs for this project center mainly around utility costs to run developer
machines, and labour costs. The labour costs are not monetary as this is an
opensourced project where the labour costs are in time spent developing for the
developers.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
The user documentation is in the form of a README file in the project
repository. This file details all installation requirements, and instructions
pertaining to installation and running the file. The user requires no training
to use this project.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
V2.0 Pong added to the base game as an additional layer to the display. Pong
also functionally reacts with the Space Invaders base game.

V3.0 Audio implemented to all interactions of Pong Invaders. BGM is will now be
functional. Audio settings can be manipulated through the title screen in
“AudioSettings.”

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
Implement a class in Java that handles collisions with any object with a
designated return type of hitbox. This way the project can scale from Space
Invaders to Pong Invaders by allowing Pong to interact functionally with Space
Invaders.
