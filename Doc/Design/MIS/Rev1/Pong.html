  State Variables:
   <br>
  handler:Handler<br>
  reference to Handler class<br>
  ref : String<br>
  no paddle sprite; however needs to be referenced as Pong is a child of Game Object <br>
   x: float<br>
   Is the x-position of pong paddle on window<br>
   y: float<br>
   Is the y-position of pong paddle on window<br>
   id: enumeration<br>
   Is the identification of which class is being referred to<br>
   velX: float<br>
   Is the velocity of Pong paddle in the x-direction<br>
   velY: float<br>
   Is the velocity of Pong paddle in the y-direction<br>
   Clamp: Game<br>
   Sets the bounds to which the pong paddle can travel to on the window<br>
   intersects: Rectangle<br>
